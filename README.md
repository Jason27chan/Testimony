# Testimonies

Hi, my name is Jason Chan. This repository contains my stories of how God changed my life in college.

Here are the links and descriptions in reverse chronological order.

1. Testimony: This is the story I would tell anyone who approaches me and asks about my story of how I came to Christ.
This story changes as God convicts me and reveals more of my heart at this pivotal point in time
2. [Intro Night Testimony](https://github.com/Jason27chan/Testimony/blob/master/Intro%20Night%20Testimony.md): 
This is the story I told at JCA's 2018 intro night. This testimony more heavily emphasizes 
community and contains my prayer for new college students.
3. [Baptism Testimony](https://github.com/Jason27chan/Testimony/blob/master/Baptism%20Testimony.md): 
This is the story I told at my baptism in October 2017. It contains the first version of my testimony
