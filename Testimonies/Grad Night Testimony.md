Hi, guys. My name is Jason Chan. This past winter, I graduated from Georgia Tech and here is my grad night testimony.

I would like to thank this church for showing me what it means to love. An imperfect family and broken relationships taught that love was earned. Love was given to those who were funny or interesting or good people. In freshman year I was overwhelmed by love because I hadn’t done anything to earn it. So thank you JCA, for loving me first. Thank you for buying me ice cream after journey bowl. Thank you for driving me home from the airport after Thanksgiving. Thank you for the finals week care-package after I annoyed you all year. Thank you for meeting up with me during a tough week. Thank you for messaging me to make sure I felt included. Thank you for inviting me over to eat all the food in your refrigerator. Thank you for teaching me to depend on Christ when I wanted to depend on myself. Thank you for praying for me. These small acts depicted the immeasurable beauty of the sacrificial love of Christ

God’s message from my four years in college is that He is faithful. God was faithful when He gave me this summer away from JCA, so I could learn to walk with Him and not depend on my community. In junior year, God was faithful when he gave me a last-minute, fall internship that became the greatest period of sanctification in my life. In sophomore year, God was faithful when I struggled with close relationships and I had to depend on Christ alone for my identity. In freshman year, God was faithful when he sat me in class next to a guy who would invite me to church, beginning my journey to confess Christ as my savior. Finally, God was faithful when He sent His son to die on our behalf and raised him to life.

Thank you God for an amazing four years. I know I can trust Him with the rest of my life.
