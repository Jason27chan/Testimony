# Baptism Testimony

In high school, I had a lot of friends of circumstance: my math friends, my track friends, my band friends, etc. 
My only consistent friend was my best friend Ivy. All throughout high school, we were each other’s comforts through 
bad tests, hard classes, and messy relationships. Whenever I felt broken or lonely, her presence would remind me 
that I was worthy of love. I began to depend on her for my happiness, and I soon learned that people will always 
fall short. The summer before college, she became so busy with her job that she couldn’t talk to me. When she couldn’t 
comfort me, I wanted her to feel as abandoned as I did. My conditional love for her ran out, and I didn’t talk to her 
for a year because I wanted my best friend to suffer as I suffere.

A person in my first college lecture invited me to JCA, where God provided me with the friends I so desperately needed. 
Through bible study and sermons, I learned about a loving God, and through the people, especially family group and my 
class, I experienced His love. In His love, I saw how imperfect mine was. Where I only loved “deserving” people, God 
loved indiscriminately. Where I loved because of what people did, God loved because of who He is. Where I turned away 
from the people that hurt me, God loved us so much that He sent His son down so that we could have victory through Jesus. 

As I was experiencing His love, God told me to forgive Ivy, but there wasn’t enough of God’s love in my heart, so God 
kept working, pursuing me through family group and class relationships. At the end of my freshman year, God had shown me 
that His love was greater than my loneliness, and for the first time, I felt free. He saved me, and when I went back home, 
I forgave Ivy.

God’s love is not self-serving, His love keeps no record of wrongs, and His love bears all things, believes all things, 
hopes all things, and endures all things. In loneliness, I was hopeless and believed that I wasn’t worthy of love, but 
in Christ, I have hope in eternal love and eternal redemption. That’s why I’ve decided to give my life to Christ.
