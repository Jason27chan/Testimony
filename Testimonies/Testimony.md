# Testimony 

When I was in high school, I didn't have a lot of friends. I had math friends, band friends, and track friends, but it felt like those relationships would fade away as soon as those events ended. The one relationship that seemed to last was the relationship with my girlfriend. I texted her every day, I hung out with her all the time, etc. She was everything to me, and she was a pretty good girlfriend, but she was a terrible god.
