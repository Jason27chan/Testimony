When I was in high school, I didn't have a lot of friends. I had math friends, band friends, and track friends, but those relationships weren't built on anything other than proximity. Those friends disappeared as soon as those events did. I did seem to have one friend that stuck around when classes ended. Because this relationship seemed to be the only thing that changed, I poured everything into her. I shared everything with her in hopes of finding some aspect of me that she'll like.
