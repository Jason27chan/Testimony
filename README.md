# Testimonies

Hi, my name is Jason Chan. This repository contains my stories of how God changed my life in college. My church was called Journey Church of Atlanta (JCA)

Here are the links and descriptions in reverse chronological order.

1. Testimony(In progress): This is the story I would tell anyone who approaches me and asks about my story of how I came to Christ.
This story changes as God convicts me and reveals more of my heart at this pivotal point in time
2. [Grad Night Testimony](https://github.com/Jason27chan/Testimony/blob/master/Testimonies/Grad%20Night%20Testimony.md):
Grad Night is an event at JCA where the graduating seniors share about how God has blessed them during their time in college. This testimony is focused on my love for the church and God's faithfulness in college.
3. [Intro Night Testimony](https://github.com/Jason27chan/Testimony/blob/master/Testimonies/Intro%20Night%20Testimony.md): 
Intro Night is one of our college ministry's first events of the year where we have fun and share about God to people who may be encountering God in a new way as they come to college. This testimony more heavily emphasizes community and contains my prayer for new college students.
4. [Baptism Testimony](https://github.com/Jason27chan/Testimony/blob/master/Testimonies/Baptism%20Testimony.md): 
This is the story I told at my baptism in October 2017. It contains the first version of my testimony
